        Science Olympiad at the University of Pennsylvania (SOUP) is a student organization at the University of Pennsylvania that organizes one of the most competitive college-sponsored Science Olympiad invitational tournaments in the country and mentors local middle school teams with the goal of spurring interest in STEM in students who might otherwise lack the opportunity.

        Science Olympiad is a non-profit organization that hosts official tournaments on a regional, state, and national level with around 7,800 teams of 15 students across all 50 states. These tournaments consist of 23 events that test students on a range of subjects, including biology, earth science, chemistry, and engineering. Many biology and physics events will involve taking an exam on a particular subject matter, such as anatomy and physiology. For some chemistry events, students will perform lab-activities at competition. All engineering events require students to bring an assembled and operational device, within the specifications of the event, to the competition with them.

    Participating in high school and middle school Science Olympiad inspired many of our members to pursue degrees and careers in science, technology, engineering, and mathematics. Our organizationâ€™s mission is to provide young students in the Philadelphia area and around the country with the opportunity to experience Science Olympiad.
