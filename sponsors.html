        <div class="col">
            <b>Our Goals</b>
            <p>SOUP is a student-run organization that aims to promote science education.
                Each spring we organize one of the most competitive high-school-level Science
                Olympiad invitational tournaments in the country. This year, our tournament
                will be on February 27th, 2021. Due to COVID-19, our tournament will be a
                virtually-connected event.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="col">
            <b>Why Your Support Matters</b>
            <p>As a student group, we receive partial funding from the university's Student Activities Council but
            have traditionally met our budget needs through corporate and Penn departmental sponsorships and donations. This
            year, we are seeking to raise $10,000 to cover event costs.</p>

            <h3>Penn Departments and Penn-Affiliated Groups</h3>
            <p>We expect an attendance of 1200 high school students working with about 70 Penn student
                proctors and event supervisors from science, math, and engineering departments at Penn.
                Many of these high school students will be attending universities soon. As such, we feel that
                this would be a great opportunity to introduce them to Penn's majors and programs.</p>
            <p>In the past, sponsoring Penn departments would set up a table with a representative to
                speak with participants in between student's competition events and before the awards
                ceremony where all high school competitors would be present. This year, we will be running
                virtual discussion panels and meet & greet panels throughout competition day.</p>
            <p>In return, we ask for a bit of funding from your department or program. A donation of $500
                - $1,500 would be enormously appreciated, and would go a long way in making our
                tournament possible, but we would be extremely grateful for any support the department
                would be willing to give.</p>
        </div>
        <p>We would love to chat or video call if you have interest in learning more about SOUP or supporting our tournament.
