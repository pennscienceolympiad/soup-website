        Our commitment to the Science Olympiad community goes beyond just running a tournament each year. We have partnered with both Hamilton and Mitchell middle schools in West Philadelphia to develop a Division B school for competition in the new Southeast Urban Regional Competition. Our coaches have been visiting the school weekly to work with the students, guiding them through material, helping them tackle challenging concepts, and along the way giving them the confidence to consider STEM as a part of their future.

        We are proud to have been invited to the Science Olympiad Philadelphia Urban Initiative, where we introduced Science Olympiad concepts to students from underserved backgrounds.
