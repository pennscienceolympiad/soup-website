        Our commitment to the Science Olympiad community goes beyond just running a tournament each year. We have partnered with Moelis Access Science Program to develop Division B teams at both Hamilton and Mitchell middle schools in West Philadelphia. Our coaches visit the schools weekly to work with the students, guiding them through material and helping them to tackle challenging concepts. Along the way, we hope to give our students the confidence to consider STEM as a part of their future.
