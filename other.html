        Our commitment to the Science Olympiad community goes beyond just running a tournament each year. We are proud to have been invited to the Science Olympiad Philadelphia Urban Initiative, where we introduce Science Olympiad concepts to students from underserved backgrounds. We have partnered with Moelis Access Science Program to volunteer at Hamilton Middle School and Mitchell Middle School in West Philadelphia. Our members visit the schools weekly to work with the students, guiding them through material and helping them to tackle challenging concepts. Along the way, we hope to give our students the confidence to consider STEM as a part of their future.
