            Given uncertainty with new COVID-19 variants and the evolving conditions surrounding the pandemic, SOUP 2022 will be a virtual tournament. The tournament, similar to last year, will be held over the course of two days (competition on Saturday, February 26, 2022 and awards ceremony on Sunday, February 27, 2022). While the tournament format is yet to be determined, we are committed to following the models proposed by the National Science Olympiad. Further information regarding tournament format will be provided in early January.
