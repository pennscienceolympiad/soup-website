        Science Olympiad at the University of Pennsylvania was founded to use the resources of an Ivy League university to support Science Olympiad in the Philadelphia area and beyond. To that end, we look forward to improving our accessibility to local and national teams alike in our second year.

            <h4>Alumni-Run</h4>
            <p class="jawn">The Penn Invitational is run top to bottom by Science Olympiad alumni. That means that coaches will be free to watch their team without running an event, and students can rest assured that their events will be run by Science Olympiad veterans.</p>

            <h4>National Schedule</h4>
            <p class="jawn">Tired of constantly changing schedules? The Penn Invitational will feature all 23 national events and a schedule that mimics the 2018 National Competition, allowing you to put you best foot forward on competition day.</p>

            <h4>Affordable Rates</h4>
            <p class="jawn">To further our goal of making our Science Olympiad experience accessible to all teams, we will be reducing our tournament fees this year to $60 for your first registered team, and $50 for additional teams.</p>
