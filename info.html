        As we get closer to the tournament date, we will be periodically releasing information about tournament logistics. All of this information will be organized in the document found below, which will be updated each time more information is released. This is the same document that has been emailed to all coaches.

    	These forms were included in an email to all coaches on November 29th; we are linking to them here for your convenience. Every participant must have a liability and a photo waiver signed and completed. Both are to be turned in on the date of the tournament. A link to the relevant waivers will be included closer to the tournament date.
