Outside of SOUP, he can be found in the Penn Band as a bari saxophone player, or somewhere trying (and failing) to convince people to watch Bachelor in Paradise with him. He participated in his high school Science Olympiad team since it was founded his sophomore year, and is excited to continue giving back to this experience that meant so much to him.",
